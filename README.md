Aircraft Crashes

I was assigned this project, desinged by my school Henry, in which I have to do the usual work of a data analyst. To develop this project I used Python, Power BI, csv files, ect. The topic is Aircraft Crashes. Below are the instructions:


# Description of the problem - context and role to be developed -

- Context:
</h1>
Air accidents are unexpected and unwanted events that involve aircraft and cause physical damage to people or the aircraft itself. An air accident can involve any type of aircraft, including commercial airplanes, private planes, helicopters, gliders, and hot air balloons.

Airline accidents can be caused by a variety of factors, such as human error, equipment failure, weather problems, maintenance problems, air traffic management failures, design problems, or manufacturing problems. And as for its consequences, they can be both in terms of human and economic losses.

That's why the aviation industry, regulatory authorities and researchers work tirelessly to improve aviation safety and prevent future accidents. On the other hand, for organizations associated with aviation, studying the causality of accidents and learning how to prevent them in the future is key to avoiding significant human losses and material damage.


- Role to develop:

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations, wants to investigate in depth the accidents that have occurred since the beginning of the 20th century. To do this, the main objective is to be able to obtain a data analysis related to this, along with a dashboard that complements the analyzes with its visualizations.

The ICAO only has a dataset on aircraft accident data, but urges the data consultancy - of which they are a part - to try to cross-reference this information with other sources of interest. This is with the aim of obtaining greater clarity and consistency in the foundations of the study.

 <b> Structure Project</b>
</h1>

 <b> 1- EDA:</b>

This project consists on three main parts. The first is the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) a python notebook format file, which is located in the same folder as the current file. There you will find the step by step of the EDA process, and analytical graphs with conclusions and explanation, all extracted from the data.

<b>2- Analysis:</b>

Then, almost at the end of this README you will find the analysis report of all the previously mentioned explored, analyzed and understood data. From the comprenhention of the data, I put my self into a data analyst roll and I came out with interesting facts and useful conclusion, that I used to answer the business questions I was told to respond.

One of these queries was to graph and measure the following KPI:
+ Evaluate the 10% decrease in the crew fatality rate in the last 10 years, compared to the previous decade.
+ (Mi KPI)

+ (MI KPI) Si llego :)

<b>3-Dashboard: </b>

The Dashboard will not be at this repository at the moment, so you can not see it right now. However, after my oral presentation, I wil dyploy the dashboard and add it to this repository. A brief definition of my Dashboard: a visual file with a specific design and layout that helps the viewer understand and interpret the analysis I did based on the instructions and KPIs.

<b>Data: </b>
The two CSV files in this repository are the data base where the information is taken of. The file 'AccidentesAviones.csv' is the file I was provided with the instructions of the project; while the file 'df_AircraftAccident.CSV' is a file created by myself, based on the previous csv file, but with some modifications that helps me to creat a optimum Dashboard
